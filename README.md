In this project, we were asked by Dr. Keogh to explore feature selection for a nearest‐neighbor classifier. I used C++ to build a program that implements two greedy search methods, forward selection and backward elimination, using leave‐one‐out cross‐validation. The code was run on three datasets (small, large and breast-cancer) and the resulting accuracy curves are included in the report.
